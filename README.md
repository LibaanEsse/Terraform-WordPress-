### Terraform-AWS-WordPress-and-EC2-CloudInit-Deployment ###

## Overview
This repository showcases hands-on learning and practical implementation of **AWS infrastructure using Terraform**, with an emphasis on real-world cloud architecture, automation, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.
Each assignment is organized as a **self-contained Terraform project**, demonstrating progressively advanced concepts such as modular infrastructure design, automated EC2 bootstrapping, and configuration management using cloud-init. All AWS resources are provisioned **entirely through Terraform**, with no manual configuration performed in the AWS Management Console.
